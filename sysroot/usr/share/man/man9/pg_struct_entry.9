pg_struct_entry \- Format of a paging structure entry 
The format of a page table/directiry entry is as following: 
.br
 Bits 31-11 is the physical frame number the entry points to\&. 
.br
 Bits 11-9 are availible for use by the OS\&. 
.br
 Bit 8 is ignored\&. 
.br
 Bit 7 is the page size in page directories, and must be 0 in page tables\&. If set to 1 in a page directory, it indicates 4MB pages\&. 
.br
 Bit 6 is the dirty bit in page tables, and must be 0 in page directories\&. In page tabes, it is set to 1 by the CPU when the page is written to\&. 
.br
 Bit 5 will be set to 1 by the CPU when the page is accessed\&. 
.br
 Bit 4 indicates whether the page has it's cache disabled\&. 
.br
 Bit 3 indictates whether write-through caching (when it is 1), or write-back caching, (when it is 0) is enabled\&. 
.br
 Bit 2 indictaes whether user mode code can access the page\&. 
.br
 Bit 1 indicates whether the page is writable\&. 
.br
 Bit 0 indicates whether the entry is present\&. If it is 0, the CU ignores the other 31 bits of the entry\&. 
.br
 Privlege bits in the entries are ANDed together, so the most restrictive privlege between the page directory and the page table wins\&.
